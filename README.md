# BST-with-frequency
This is a binary search tree I completed as part of my first year. 
The tree is a standard binary search tree with one difference. This tree records the frequency of each node. 
For example if the same number was the to be added twice the tree will record this and store the frequency of that node as 2. 
The Scanner class was used to allow for inputs to be taken from the command line.
